# Conclusion

This project has provided a solid foundation for collaboration and programming for future assessments. As a group, we identified Python as our programming strength, hence most of our analysis is done in this language, with some supporting R analysis. For our first assessment, most of the code provided is borrowed from other sources as we our main objectives were to find 'good' datasets, practice using GitHub and to truly understand the code which we were running. 

As the brief for the project was broad, each team member explored a different dataset and explored different data analysis techniques, without working towards a common goal or trying to answer the same question. This has led to different analytical reports under the same theme, however in future reports, we would like to approach the brief more collaboratively.

The data we explored and the visualisations produced weren't that diverse or 'interesting', as the majority of the data sets only considered one location. In future analysis, we could compare weather data for different locations and overlay these datasets on the same graphs. 

In future renditions of this work, we would like to explore the connection between weather and other variables, such as crop yield, storm frequency and sea level. This would provide insight into more interesting questions about causation and correlation and provide the basis for predictive techniques.

Our group had no experience sharing code via GitHub, hence it was a slightly tedious task as GitHub and its other interfaces aren't the most intuitive to use. However, our regular in-person group meetings allowed us to learn from each other's mistakes and become more familiar with GitHub.
