# Conclusion

The data we explored and the visualisations wasn't that diverse or 'interesting', as the majority of the data sets only considered one location. In future analysis, it could be worth comparing weather data for different locations and overlaying these datasets on the same graphs for easier visualisation. 

In future renditions of this work, we would like to explore the connection between weather and other variables, such as crop yield, storm frequency and sea level. This would provide insight into more interesting questions about causation and correlation and provide the basis for predictive techniques.
