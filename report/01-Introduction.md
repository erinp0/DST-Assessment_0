# Introduction

Our first project focuses on the analysis of weather data with the following main objectives:

* Programming experience,

* Collaborative experience on GitHub,

* Practice at assessments.

We explored 4 different datasets, each of which can be found below:
* [Leeds Weather Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muthuj7/weather-dataset?resource=download),
* [Seattle Weather Data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aryansan69/notebookbc95ebdba5/data?select=seattle-weather.csv),
* [UK Weather Station Data 1941-2020](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/josephw20/uk-met-office-weather-data?resource=download),
* [Bristol Weather Data 2021](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather/weather-data-services) - the data was collated on this website and stored as a .csv file (see 05-PythonAnalysis),
* [Portland International Airport Weather Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wpbSabi/weather/main/towardsDS/weather_towardsds.csv).

In this project, we aimed to explore the different types of weather data available by downloading available datasets and successfully running analysis on these datasets. We encountered different types of data, both categorical and quantitative data, and therefore were able to perform different types of analysis. We managed to modify the code we found to provide meaningful and insightful visualisations.
